## Project Introduction
Food delivery services are more vihttps://github.com/ajinkyagadgil/db-project-fall21/blob/main/Delivery1/ERD_P1.pngtal than ever with the possibility of the Corona virus and local businesses are looking for simple ways to bring food to consumers without having to recruit delivery staff. Many analysts believe that even when things return to normal, things will be worse that meal delivery will be something we've all become accustomed to as a part of our daily lives. On campus, students adore food delivery services and campuses despise the constant flow of students. While companies like UberEats and GrubHub are willing to deliver on campus, many schools are wondering for safety and health considerations, they're debating whether they should take control of the service and ensure that only students and approved university personnel bring food on campus. The objective of this project is to create a food delivery system thet will only allow university people to invade.
